\subsubsection{Interests}
I have a ton of personal interests that line up with this project. For one, I'm really interested in simple systems with complex behavior. A 3-d elastic pendulum is a perfect example - a baby could understand the system, and even have a good intuition for what happens. Actually describing the system, though, is hard - and the emergence of that complexity fascinates me.

\subsubsection{Wishes}
Additionally, I'm interested in the materials science aspect. While the fundamental material properties of the spider webs are more precursors to the project than elements of study in the project, I'm looking forward to getting more experience working with physical properties of materials and implementing simulations based on those properties.

\subsubsection{Desires}
I also want to improve my numerical simulation abilities. I had a ton of fun during mod sim, but I ultimately felt like the simulations we made were too trivial, and I understood everything they told me before I ran them. Doing a project like this, which combines an interesting simulation and hard, nonlinear optimization on top of that simulation will be incredibly engaging for me. This is partly because it requires more optimization of and understanding of the simulation itself and partly because it incorporates more work on top of the simulation.
