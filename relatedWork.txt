1. This work goes back to the familiarity of both Abe and I with materials science.
We both enrolled in materials science freshman year and are excited to take a 
different approach to the investigation of material properties. Additionally we 
both have a huge respect for the work that Spiderman does to keep this world 
safe and feel that we truly owe it to him to ensure that the world know about
the legitimacy of his abilities.
