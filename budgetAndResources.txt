1. The existing resources we plan on utilizing are firstly, both of our Olin 
laptops. These will be invaluable in our modeling as we would be unable to 
do this without the compute power that these allow us. Addittionally we may
attempt to leverage Olin's brutus, a distributed supercomputer, if any of
our calculations require intensive compute power.

Additionally we intend to uise the openopt library for python in order to 
solve any non-linear differential equations we happen across in our studies
These are bound to occur, and rather than getting a purely analytical and exact
solution we many have to settle for a numerical optimization in some cases.
